Not until one century after we, the humankind, are able to flap our wings several meters above the Earth, finally we can land our feet on the Moon's surface.

Well, of course not _our feet_ literally, but you got the point.

My favorite theory related to that is the [Butterfly Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect). It says that one flap of the butterfly's wings in the amazon forest causes the tornado in the arizona. Wild. Small effect as such thing, will cause the entire system of the planet goes unexpected. 

Note that similarity with those narrations of the notion, to change or to cause the bigger event, just take a small step, persistently, and see the differences. Without energy pumped, [LASER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser) device can not produce the ray. Without effort, we can not achieve anything, even a smallest thing we can think.

In the end, this post is not about Me telling you, this post is all about Me **warning** myself.
